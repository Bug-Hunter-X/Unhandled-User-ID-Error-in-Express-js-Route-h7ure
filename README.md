# Unhandled User ID Error in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: failing to handle cases where a requested resource (in this case, a user) does not exist.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to access a user object using an ID that might not be present in the `users` array.  If no user with the specified ID is found, the `find()` method returns `undefined`, leading to potential errors or crashes.

The solution adds a check to see if a user with the given ID exists before proceeding. If not, a proper 404 response is sent.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Express.js applications to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.
